# BubbleWrap-Pop

Coding instruction

Create a game that allows a user to "pop" bubble wrap when they click on an image
Include a reset button that "unpops" all the bubbles
Here are images you can use for bubble popped and unpopped
 
Note: You probably need to pass the object that received the event in your event handler. See: Javascript 'this'
-Example: the click event on the unpopped bubble image would make the following function call: 'popBubble(this.id)'
Try implementing this CSS bubble background Here
Extra credit: Play a pop sound!

Extra(x2) credit: Only allow a user to pop a bubble once (Aka only play the pop sound once).
Extra(x3) credit: Allow the user to choose how many bubbles will appear on the screen to pop.
Extra(x4) credit: Have a "win" event when all bubbles on the screen are popped!
Extra(x5) credit: Add a theme chooser to allow the user to select between different themes on the page.
Extra(x6) credit: Randomly rotate the popped image to make the popped bubbles look varied!
